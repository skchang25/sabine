# Questions (Answer these in the homework2.py file as comments):

# 1) What’s the difference between Git, GitHub, and Git Bash?
	#Git is the software that is able to run GitHub and Git Bash, it 
	#tracks and saves cahnges in your files. Github is able to manage and stores 
	#repositories, files and directories which can be shared and accessed, similar
 	#to a google drive. Git Bash is an application allowing users to interact
 	#with Git code and the format of git, this is used often 
	#for windows computers/ linux systems.

 # 2) What’s the difference between the terminal and the command line?
	#The terminal is an user interface allowing the user to interact with files on their computer and 
	#their operating system, which can be used to make changes to code and locate and create 
	#files. The command line is the first line of user input into the terminal. This is where the user can
	#input commands to change directories, enter files and locate information in a specified language.  
	#and directories and interact with all of 
# 3) How does Windows PowerShell differ from Git Bash?
	# Git Bash uses a Unix/ Linux based system, allowing commands and terminology that we have often used in class, such 
	#as ls, to run where the commands are linked Git. Windows Powershell uses a Powershell core that is created by
	#by/ for Microsoft hardware and is object oriented, using spesific terminology such as cmdlets.  
# 4) What’s the difference between Anaconda, conda, and Python?
	#Anacoda allows for users to write code on their devices locally and manage projects, coming equipped with 
	#certain langagues and Conda beuilt in. Conda is a software allowing users to create environments for their
	# projects within the terminal, including handling updates and software packages, and allowing creating separate 
	#spaces where separate languages can be used in each project. Python is a language in coding that can be used to 
	#create a project 
# 5) What is VS Code? 
	# VS Code is an interface where users can interact, run, edit and debug code on their device.
# 6) What is a Jupyter Notebook? How is it different from Jupyter Lab?
	# Jupyter Notbook software allowing users to run and edit files of code. Jupyter notebook is a software, 
	#however it differe from Jupyter notebook as its scale and functionality is more comprohensive for larger projects, 
	#whereas is a simpiler interface, allowing for users to still run and edit code, hwoever can output more types
	#of information, such as data plots and imaging.
 # 7) What does ~/ mean?
	# In the terminal, this indicates that the user is in the user directory on their device.
# 8) What’s the difference between an absolute path and a relative path?
	# The absolute path would display the complete pathway taken from the user directory to the current 
	#directory/file. The relative pathway would return a part of the path taken to get to the current 
	#directory/file, sometimes starting from the current parent or root directory to the cwd.
# 9) Imagine you're in your "yourname" repo. Write the absolute and relative paths to "course_assignments/homework2".
	# absolute path: User/Python_Decal_fa25/sabine/course_assignments/homework2.
	 #realtive path: sabine/course_assignments/homework2 or ../course_assignments/homework2
# 10) What command lets you move from "course_assignments/homework2/" to "course_assignments/"?
	# cd ../ will move the use back to the parent directory/ previous directory.
# 11) What would rm ./ do in your current directory? (Don’t try it!)
	# This can remove a full pathway relative to the current directory.
# 12) What do the following commands do?
# git add
# git commit
# git push
	# These save changes to your files to github.
# 13) What's the difference between "git add ." and "git add <file>"?
	# git add . save all changes made to all file and directories, while git add <file> will add only changes made 
	#to the spesificed files to github.
# 14) What do "git status" and "git log -1" do?
	# git status allows you to see the state of your git repository, such if your file/ directory is watched by 
	#git and what cahgnes were committed/ need to be committed to git, while git log -1 returns a list of commits 
	#to your github in chronological order, including the commit message, author and date.
# 15) What’s the difference between cloning a repository and pulling from it?
	# Cloning a repositroy allows the user to create a local version of the respository on their device, complete 
	#with the all changes made to the remote repository while pulling from a remote repository takes just the 
	#changes made and commits them to the local repository. 
# 16) What has been your most frustrating bug or error in this class so far? How did you troubleshoot or fix it?
	#The only issues I have run into so far has been moving files, I was able to review the notes and 
	#syntax to fix this. 
# 17) What’s a question you still have? What’s something you’re confused about?
	# I was still a bit confused about how the realative pathways worked, does this have a 
	#static defenition of always starting from the parent directory or simplifying to 
	#../currentdirectory, does it depend on the situation or the specifications and reutrn 
	#otherwise.
 # 18) Tell me a fun fact!
	#In the documentary The Edge of All We Know, the very simplified intrepretted 
	#implication of Hawking's radiation is that any random peice of matter can be
	 #radiated from a black hole as it was found the particles emitted from a black hole had 
	#no relation to the matter that originaly entered the black hole. The example they used
	 #for this was to say the radiation could take form of a piano or trombone! 
 # 19) Print your favorite math expression you've 
#learned in Python so far. # (Hint: Use print() and add a comment explaining what it does.)
print(5%2)
	# Returns the remainder after the most whole divisors is taken from the first number 
	#(5%2 = 5-2(2) = 4, 5-4 =1)
