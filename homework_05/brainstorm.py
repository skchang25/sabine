Brainstorm:
 1). Microlensing/blakcholes, binary star systems, rocket propulsion, star 
luminocity and oribtal motion
 2).- https://www.astronexus.com/projects/hyg ( Data set of star 
information consisting of naked eye data and comprehensive and 
high-acuracy, including a range of distances and provides positon, names 
brightness and spectral information).
    - https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/binary-neutron-star-merger( Data 
set includign waveform data for various binary systems, inclduing neutron 
stars and black hole mergers)
    - 
https://data.nasa.gov/dataset/maven-magnetometer-mag-magnetic-field-and-orbital-position-sun-state-and-payload-coordinat 
(Data sets including infromation on electric and magnetic feilds and 
plasma environments relating to orbital position).

 3). Using dictornaries to hold data and sort data for with relevant 
indicators

 4). Creating a dictionary of star infroamtion and sorting/ graphing the 
revlevant information. Creating a simulation of star movement or of 
waveforms.
